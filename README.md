# Email Spam Classification with Machine Learning

This project involves the development of a robust machine learning model using Python and Scikit-learn to classify emails as either spam or not spam. The model was trained using the Naive Bayes Classifier for optimal performance.

## Overview
The primary goal of this project is to classify emails as spam or not spam, based on their content. This was achieved by conducting comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's characteristics and patterns, followed by data preprocessing and model development.

## Project Highlights
- **Data Exploration:** Performed detailed exploratory data analysis to uncover insights and identify patterns and distributions in the email dataset.
- **Model Development:** Utilized the Naive Bayes Classifier algorithm, which is highly effective for classification tasks
- **Key Tools & Technologies:**
  - **Python**
  - **Scikit-learn**
  - **NumPy & Pandas**
  - **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)
  
## Steps Involved
1. **Data Collection:** Gathered a labeled email dataset containing spam and non-spam emails.
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Data cleaning (removal of unnecessary characters, stop words)
   - Feature extraction using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identified key patterns and distributions within the dataset to guide preprocessing decisions.
4. **Model Training:** Applied the Naive Bayes Classifier algorithm to build the classification model.
5. **Evaluation:** Evaluated the modelâ€™s performance using various metrics, such as accuracy, and confusion matrix.
